--> What is a Software ?
	Software is the Collection of Programs

>> Three Types of Software

	- System Software(OS)
		Example - MacOS, Linux, Windows

	- Programming Software
		Example - Compiler for different programming Languages
	
	- Application Software
		Example - Applications like Zoom, ServiceNow 


>> Software Testing 

SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle

Software Testing is part of SDLC

--> Why do we do Software Testing ?

	- We do it to detect and identify the defects in the Software
	
--> Benifits of doing Software Testing :

	- By doing Software Testing we improve the Quality of Software
	- It also ensures that the Software is delivered on time
	- Also checks whether the Software is Within Budget
	- Ensuring Software Developed meets the requirements
	- Maintenance


-->> Types of Software Testing :

		- Manual Testing
		- Automation Testing
	

1. Manual Testing - 
		Testing is done manually
			
	Example : Producing 10 pens and testing manually whether it works or not
			  But when 10000 pens are produced it is not possible for a single person to do
			  Also the cost involved for hiring more employees is more
			  
2. Automation Testing -
		Testing is done with the help of a Pre Developed Software or any machine 

	Example : The cons in the previous example can be saved by engaging a machine and investing money on it / building a Testing Software
			  This is called Automation Testing



--> Error : It is a Human Mistake
			Example - Syntax Error

--> Bug / Defect : If some feautre is not working as per our expectation
				   Unwanted behaviour of application
				   Example - Clicking on Login and it Logging out
				
--> Failure : End User Action 
			  Example - If Status is not getting uploaded in Whatsapp we say it is a Failure


Bug / Defect - Tester's point of View
Faiure - End Users point of View


--> 10 Benifits of doing Software Testing -
	
	1. Testing at early stage of Development saves the time later
			- Better Late than never

	2. Software Testing ensures there are low/no bugs

	3. Customer Satisfaction

	4. To determine the Software performance

	5. We all make mistakes - Testing the system to rectify the mistakes

	6. Reduce Cost

	7. End users must have flawless experience 

	8. Reputation


-->> SDLC 

1. Planning and Requirement Analysis - Stakeholders, Domain Experts, Senior Members
2. Designing						 - System Architects and Developers
3. Development						 - Developers(Programmers)
4. Testing							 - Testers
5. Maintenance						 - Developers


--> Assignment -
	Prepare SRS for a client who needs Gmail like Software

Solution : 

	Requirement -

		1.




--> Types of SDLC 

	1. Waterfall Model
	2. Spiral Model
	3. V - Model

1. Waterfall Model -

		- Most Popular
		- Each Step is executed only after the previous Step is completed
		- It is simple to execute
	
	Steps in Waterfall Mode :
		- Requirements : We ask the customer a complete requirement 
						 And prepare SRS

		- Design : Helps in specifying Hardware and system requirements 
					Specifying the whole Architecture

		- Implementation : The App is divided into units(Modules)
						    At the end this will be integrated
						    Then Unit Testing is performed

		- Verification - Entire system is tested for Functinal and Non Functional Tester
						 Then Product is deployed 

		- Maintenance - If some issue comes up in client environment
						It will be fixed via update etc...						   

	

	Advantage : 
		
		- Easy to understand and use
		- Each Phase has specific deliverables and review process
		- Phases are proccessed and completed one at a time
		- Suitable for small project 
	
	Disadvantage :

		- Once Application is in testing stage, it is very difficult to go back and change
		- Software cannot be deployed until all the process are completed
		- High Risk and Uncertainity
		- Not good for complex and Object Oriented Projects
		- Poor Model for long and ongoing Projects
		- Not suitable for the projects where requirements are at a moderate to high risk of changing


	When to use ?

		- Only when Requirements are well known, clear and fixed
		- Technology is understood
		- No ambiguous requirements
		- Project is short
		- Ample resources with required expertise are available freely
	

2. Spiral Model -
		- It is iterative model
		- This model overcomes the drawbacks of Waterfall model
		- Evolutionary Software Process model which is combination of an iterative nature of prototyping and systematic ascpects of Traditional Waterfall Model
		- We follow Spiral Model Whenever there is a dependency on the Modules
		- In every cycle a new software version will be released
		- Software will be released in multiple version, Therefore this model is also known as Control model
		- This kind of Model is suitable for product based company
				Example : Microsoft, Facebook, Whatsapp

	When to use ?

		- When costs and risk evaluation is important
		- For medium to high risk projects
		- Users are unsure of their needs
		- Requirements are complex
		- Significant changes are expected
	
	Four Fold Procedure :

		- Planning 
				- The objectives and constraints of the project are determined and are documented 

		- Risk Analysis
				- All possible alternatives, which can help in developing a cost effective project are analyzed
				- This phase identfies and resolves all the possible risks in the project Development
		
		- Engineering
				- The actiual development of the project is carried out
				- The output of this phase is passed through all the phases itertively in order to obtain improvements in the same

		- Customer evaluation 
				- Developed product is passes on to the customer in order to receive customer's comments and suggestions
				- This phase is very much similar to Testing Phase 

	

	Advantage :
		
		- Changing requirements can be accomodated
		- Allows for extensive use of Prototypes
		- Requirements can be captured more accurately
		- Users see the system early
		- Early and frequent feedback from users

	Disadvantage :

		- End of the project may not be known early
		- Not suitable for small or low risk projects and could be expensive for small projects
		- Project is complex
		- Spiral may go indefinitely
		- Risk Assessment expertise is required



3. V - Model -

	- It is in the form of V hence V-Model	
	- It is also known as Verification and Validation Model
	- Development of each phase is directly associated with Testing Phase
	- The next phase starts only after completion of the previous phase

Speciality of this model 
	
	We can Identify the problem at the early stage because testing happens in each stage


>> Static Testing - Testing the project related documents(reviewing, walkthrough, inspection)

	- White Box Testing
	- Black Box Testing

>> Dynamic Testing - This is actual testing

		Techniques -
					- Unit Testing
					- Integration Testing
					- System Testing
					- UAT (User Acceptance Testing)


--> What is Verification ?
	Checks whether we are building the right product or not(What to build ?)
	Focuses on Documentation
	Verification is Typically involved in (reviewing, walkthrough, inspection)

--> What is Validation ?
	Checks whether we are building the product right or not(How to build ?)
	Takes place after verification are completed
	Focuses on Software
	Validation is Typically involved in actual testing (Dynamic testing)


	Advantages : 
 
		- This is a highly disciplined model and Phases are completed one at a time.
		- V-Model is used for small projects where project requirements are clear.
		- Simple and easy to understand and use.
		- This model focuses on verification and validation activities early in the life cycle thereby enhancing the probability of building an error-free and good quality product.
		- It enables project management to track progress accurately.
	
	Disadvantages : 
 
		- High risk and uncertainty.
		- It is not a good for complex and object-oriented projects.
		- It is not suitable for projects where requirements are not clear and contains high risk of changing.
		- This model does not support iteration of phases.
		- It does not easily handle concurrent events.


--> This Model is used for Small to Medium sized projects


Other Types of Models 
	
	- Incremental Model
	- RAD Model
	- Agile Model
	- Iterative Model



-->> STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)

		- STLC is a sequence of activities conducted during testing process to ensure software quality goals are meets

	Phases of STLC - 
			
			1. Requirement Analysis			- QA interacts with various StakeHolders like client, Business Analyst, System Analyst, Technical Lead/ Development Manager 
											  Takes decision on What all tests will be performed

			2. Test Planning  				- It is a document which contains the plan related to all testing activities which needs to be done to deliver a quality product
											  Senior QA Manager determines Test Plan Strategy along with efforts and cost estimates for the project
											  The focus is to describe :
											  		- What to test ?
													- What cannot be tested ?
													- Tools used for testing ?
													- Resources
													- Test Duration
													- Risks and Contingencies Planning
													

			3. Test Case Development		- Testing Team prepares Test cases
											  Prepares Test Data  
											  Cases reviewed by peers or QA Lead 
											  RTM(Requirement Traceability Matrix) prepared 
											  RTM is Industry accepted format for tracking requirements. We can track backward and forward Traceability
											  OOB Thinking

											
			4. Environment Setup			- Tools required for testing(Both Hardware and Software)
											- Tools like -
												Selenium
        										ATF for Seleneum
        										QTP
        										RPA
												Can be done parallel with test case development phase
												We can have multiple QA Server



			5. Test Execution				- Testers
											  Bugs are reported to Development Team
											  Development Team resolves bugs and it is retested to ensure it is bug free and ready to go live

			6. Test Closure					- After Product being delivered
											  Ensures Test completion		
											  		  Handover Test Artifacts
													  Project Retrospectives


>> Selenium - It is a browser optimized framework that is commonly used for writing end to end test for web application

--> Testing - Development Point of View

	Application - Developer

- Before engaging the testing team to test the code it has to be tested by the Developer
- This Testing phase is called as the Unit Testing
		- In the Unit Testing, Developer test the functionalities he has developed

	
- Develop a code --> Test -->  



>> Testing 
	- Manual Testing
	- Automated Testing 

- Manual Testing :

	- The Software Test Engineer have to manually check every functionality and feature
	- He has to prepare the Test Cases
	- The test cases are also called as bugs
	- There is a priority associated with every bug
	- What are the user personas and how do they use the application

Excercise

	- Testing User Personas for the Medical Expense Form
		- Find out the possible personas who will be using the application 

Solution : 

	- Employee (end User): will be able to only write
	- Hospital Administration: Read, Write, update, Delete
	- Hospital Help Desk: Read, Write
	- Hospital billing Department: Read, Write, Update
	- Doctors: Read, Update(Additional Comments, not fields with payment details)
	- Insurance Help Desk: Read
	- Insurance Admin: Read, and Update comments


Excercise 

	- Access to the Application	
		- Provide access to create incidents, change, requests and problem to the users of this application 
	
Solution :

	- Giving different ITIL Roles to the Personas



Excercise 

	- Add an option for :
			- Create an Incident --> Top Left (Three Lines)
			- Create a Problem --> Near the Submit Button
			- Call Doctor --> Top Right --> This should open an request to service portal


Solution :

		Create UI Actions and insert appropriate script of Incident, Problem and Request

		Scripts can be obtained from UI Actions under Sytem Definitions


>> Test Case

Creating a Test Case Template

	- Test ID : It is also called as Issue Id, Case ID, Case No
		- Naming Convention : ProjectName_ModuleName_Number [RBT_IM_001]  
										(or)
							  ModuleName(Short)_CaseID  [IM001]

	- Issue Description 

	- Expected Output

	- Actual Output

	- Reference ID : Can be like Knowledge Article 

	- Defect ID 

	- Cycle 1 - First Round of Testing

	- Cycle 2 - Second Round of Testing

	- Comments : Our comments about the product / Application

	- Tested By : Name of the Tester

	- Date



-->> Software Testing goals

	- A good test case is one that has probability of finding any undiscovered bug
	- A good test is not redundant
	- A successful test is one that uncovers a yet discovered error
	- It should be simple, should not be complex
	- To check if the system does what it is expected to do
	- To check if the system is fit for purpose
	- To check if the system meets the requirements and be executed Successfully in the intended environment
